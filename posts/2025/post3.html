            <h1>Again Update</h1>
            <p><em>Posted on December 15, 2025</em></p>

            <h2>Havent talked about Again in a while.</h2>

            <h3>I sort of talk about it on my discord.</h3>
            <p>Often stream development there as well. The game is getting remastered, or more like rebuilt entirely. I have big intentions to create a genuinely large game that gets a steam release. I dont know how we are ever gonna get a proper budget though. Cant use pirated aseprite forever.</p>
            <p>The battle system will be getting reworked. We were discussing it before. It's a debate between pokemon-like fighting or fighting in the overworld.</p>
            <p>Story hasnt made an advancement yet. Thats going to be the hardest part. I want to make it have different endings based on your choices, but that will involve a lot of time and effort in the script. I wonder if it would be easier to hire a genuine writer. Could be a lot easeier.</p>
            <p>The soundtrack has been fully remade in FL studio. It should technically be better, but thats always up for debate. Memelian has made 1 or 2 songs for it as well. They are good, I want to use them in some sort of techy zone. </p>
            <p>Art has been sort of moved along. I made a proper sprite for The Unknown. Still have stolen tilemaps though. That should be the next priority but anyway.</p>
