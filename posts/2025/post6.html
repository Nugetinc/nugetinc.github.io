            <h1>Again Update #2</h1>
            <p><em>Posted on December 15, 2025</em></p>

            <h2>Slow and steady.</h2>

            <h3></h3>
            <p>We, or maybe I need to finish the fight concept for Again. I need to find some more people that can help out on it, in any category. I'm going pretty alright on the programming, but I might need some help later on.</p>
            <p>I want to get a beta out by christmas. It would be a nice gift to literally no one. Thats a problem as well. I have no way of promoting the game. Could just get someone else to do it, but I want to help in a monetary way. </p>
            <p>I know i dont have to, but it feels nice to contribute in another way.</p>
            <p>Also, the game will have an easy mod framework. It will most likely not release on launch, but it shouldnt take too long to add.</p>
            <p>On the topic of release, we preferably want a late 2026 date, but any earlier could be expected. Phonix keeps fire reacting me bro it is very annoying when I am hard at work.</p>
            <p>Remember, this game is being made by only 3 people right now, so any of this can change at any time.</p>
            <p>I really hope we can make a decent game. It has been my dream to make something even a little successful, and this is the closest I have been so far.</p>
            <p>An Again GMTK update should be coming out in the next 5 days, which includes an Android build. We have intentions to get this on the play store, but in the current scope, it doesnt seem needed. Same goes for iOS. We will host an IPA package you can install using other methods, but a genuine App store release will take a while.</p>
            <p>The Game is fully functional at this point, but yeah we just need to finish the fight.</p>
            <p>Art and concepts for characters is another issue I'm not looking forward to. Character design has never been my strong suit. I am yet to ask anyone else on the dev team if they could, but for now, the 2 will have to do. We could always just do the lazy way and create recolours but that doesnt seem like a very great way.</p>
