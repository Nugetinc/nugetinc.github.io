            <h2>Hello. This is my first proper post on this.</h2>

            <h3>Havent done much recently.</h3>
            <p>I Got a M4 Macbook Air and I use that as my primary device. It's very powerful. I wish I had of got the 512GB model instead however.</p>
            <p>Finished RDR2 the other night. First time a video games made me cry I think. Genuinely well written game. Fuck Micah.</p>
            <p>School finishes in less than a week, then I'm on summer holidays. I dont think I'll use this website very much. Not a huge fan of writing a lot either, but I feel like I have to in order to make it look good enough. I dont know if that makes sense.</p>
