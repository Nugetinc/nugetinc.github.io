            <h1>Update #2</h1>
            <p><em>Posted on December 15, 2025</em></p>

            <h2>Not much of an update.</h2>

            <h3>Got FL Studio on my Macbook, so music production will continue along.</h3>
            <p>I started streaming on Twitch. Played some balatro. I might stream game dev there if all works out.</p>
            <p>Maybe this blog will be good, I can look back on it and see how things have changed.</p>
            <p>Had to play golf today. Was pretty mediocre. Got a hole in one though. I'm the best at golf. </p>
            <p>Some work on the Titanium website has been done, and that should come out relatively soon. That will host up to date information on the game, as well as the downloads hosted on a better server, which overall should be cheaper. </p>
            <p>Personal updates will mostly always be smaller then any serious projects, because I dont find them very entertaining. It also doesnt seem like something that the reader would want.</p>
