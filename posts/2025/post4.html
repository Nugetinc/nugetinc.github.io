            <h2>Most of them are gone.</h2>

            <h3>I have a habit of not saving work, or just losing it in general.</h3>
            <p>The original project files for the Again 2 GMTK version have been lost to time. Half the songs I make for other projects like Tetran or Floppycent have been lost. I really wish I made better choices when it comes to this stuff. I still legally own the tetran soundtrack so if that idiot touches them he will fucking hear about it.</p>
            <p>Some Floppycent songs have been archived on my youtube, but only 2 of the 10 I made. There was only ever 4 Tetran songs and 4 Again songs currently.</p>
